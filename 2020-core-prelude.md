BitShares Core Team Members, Roles and Budgeted Effort
======================================================
BitShares Core Team constitutes a small, dedicated, and seasoned group of professionals.  These are highly-skilled engineers, some with doctorate level education in the programming and logic design industry.  As such, they are prized assets of the BitShares community who should be retained.   Understanding the aforementioned devalued state of the chain, these committed members of the BitShares community are prepared to accept substantially lower hourly rates than previously contracted.

**Team Roles and Rates**

| Roles (described below)         | Rate (USD) | Job Position |
|:------------------------------- | :---------:| ------------:|
| Manager                         |  $35/hour  |  Closed |

**Hardcap/premium definition:**
This Worker reintroduces payouts in BTS, instead of fiat equivalent BitAssets. As such, in the case of appreciation in value of the BTS token over time, this worker will cap employee pay at the value of 0.015 USD per 1 BTS token, and the paid BTS amount will be calculated by this formula：

`hourly paid BTS amount = min(cap amount, 1.5 * Rate_in_USD/BTS_market_price)`

In other words, BTS payouts are considered fixed (per table 1) as long as the price is <0.0225 USD per 1 BTS token. In case of the price >0.0225 USD, amount of BTS used for payout will worth 1.5 times of the rates in USD based on the BTS market price.

Terms of Worker/Agreement
==================

1) Team hour reports and code audit will be done once every 3 weeks. A single collective team invoice will be issued by the Worker Manager (Milos Preocanin) with previous approval by the Audit Manager (Abit More).

2) This worker max budget is calculated by the max amount of hours available by each team member. **All unused BTS will be returned to the reserve pool by appointed escrow**.

3) Milos Preocanin will be held as the principal responsible contact for this worker, on behalf of “Zavod Premik”.

4) This worker's agreement is crafted as a quick and urgent mini project with pre-defined estimates.

5) This worker budget has calculated 3% escrow fees.

6) If at any point the price of BTS:USD is beneath $0.0075, each member of the team individually reserves the right to cease their contribution to development, process audit and their outstanding invoices to for all work to date, and exit the contract without any further constraints. (Worker Manager position excluded)

6.2. Releases will not be postponed in case of Point 6), but just exclude missing deliveries
